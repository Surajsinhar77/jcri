// Hosting js
/* Hosting in javaScript is  a mechanism where varible and function declaration are moved to the top of the scope before the code execute */

// If we declare later before the it execute

// for example 1
console.log(Fname);
var Fname = "suraj";

// for example 2  ( if we use let )
// console.log(Fname);
// let Fname = = "suraj";
